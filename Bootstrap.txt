Welcome to Learners Aide Video !! 

This is part two of Bootstrap tutorial, in this video we will discuss how to download & install bootstrap to your local machine.

It is very easy to setup and start using Bootstrap. This video will explain how to download and setup Bootstrap. We will also discuss the Bootstrap file structure, and 

demonstrate its usage with an example.

You can download the latest version of Bootstrap from http://getbootstrap.com/. This website also has all the documentation you need to get started with bootstrap.

Here you can see two button
   -- Download Bootstrap − Clicking this, you can download the precompiled and minified versions of Bootstrap CSS, JavaScript, and fonts. No documentation or original 

source code files are included.

   -- Download Source − Clicking this, you can get the latest Bootstrap LESS and JavaScript source code directly from GitHub.

For better understanding and ease of use, we have downloaded and use a precompiled version of Bootstrap throughout the tutorial. Once the compiled version Bootstrap is 

downloaded, extract the ZIP file, and you will see the following file/directory structure

For this course, I am going to use Visual Code as the editor. You can use any editor of your choice.

Here are the steps to create your first web page with Bootstrap:

  -- Create a new blank html file and save that file naming boostrap-tutorial.html
  -- To use bootstrap in your website, copy the folder that contains 3 sub-folders (css, fonts, & js) in your website project folder.
  -- There is a basic template available at the following link. Copy and paste the template code in index.html
       http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#template

Here you can see the jquery.js, bootstrap.min.js and bootstrap.min.css files that are included to make a normal HTM file to the Bootstrapped Template. Just make sure to include jQuery library before you include Bootstrap library.

You congratulation for making your first page using bootstrap.

Bootstrap Grid System

Welcome to Learners Aide Video !! 

In this video we will discuss, How to create page layouts using bootstrap grid system. 

One of the very important concept that we need to understand in Bootstrap is it's Grid System. Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that house your content. The Grid System consists of 12 columns.

Let us now  create a 3 column layout using the Bootstrap Grid System. The 3 column layout should be as shown below.  

As per the image show the page should be divided into 3 columns, one important thing to keep into mind is that, the sum should be equal to 12, because the bootstrap grid system consists of 12 columns.

Geebee University Portal Updates:


As per the excel provided by you we have imported the data successfully using the Plugin. Below are some points on which we need to work on before implementing the changes on Front End:

   --- We have to add custom some more fields in Program Master in Wordpress
  
   --- While importing the data, we got to know that, we have to import the country, university & course data separately. As the plugin does not provide importing the data to custom taxanomies. We are trying to get some resolution for this if possible.
 
   --- After importing is completed, we have to check the image url, for this its better you provide some random size images for now in the excel with server path, as while importing there was an option to import the images from excel using server path links like http://www.example.com/images/01.jpg
In this scenario, the plugin will try to import the image directly.


Once, we are done with first point we can show you some implementation in front end, this will be done till next weekend with frontend pages.
